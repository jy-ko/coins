### Built With
- React, styled components 
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/docs/installation/)
- API: [Alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

<!-- TODO: List any MAJOR libraries/frameworks (e.g. React, Tailwind) with links to their homepages. -->

## Features

- A user can search a stock by the ticker symbol or the company name 
- On choosing a stock, the user can see basic information about the company along with a few financials
- Then, the user can click on either one of the tabs to see a candlestick chart or a financials table.
- A user can switch on/off dark mode (defaults to dark mode)


## Improvements to make
- x axis labels
- render a table that shows in-depth financials in the second tab
- optimize api calls
- typescript
- tests

- Maybe add a feature to allow users to save their favourites
